# Customer Churn Prediction System

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict customer churn and support data-driven retention strategies. It combines data preprocessing, model training, explainability, and a deployed web interface built using Streamlit.

## Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem for subscription-based businesses, as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones.  
The goal of this project is to **identify customers who are likely to churn** and provide **clear, actionable insights** that can help businesses take proactive measures.

Rather than focusing only on model accuracy, this project emphasizes:
- Explainability
- Business relevance
- Deployment readiness

## Key Features

- Predicts churn probability for individual customers
- Categorizes churn risk into Low, Medium, and High
- Displays top risk drivers influencing the prediction
- Provides business-oriented retention recommendations
- Clean and modern Streamlit-based user interface
- Optional SHAP-based explainability analysis (offline)
- Deployment-ready project structure
